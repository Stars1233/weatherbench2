# WeatherBench 2 - A benchmark for the next generation of data-driven global weather models

**ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ [WeatherBench-X](https://github.com/google-research/weatherbenchX) has been released. It provides an updated version of our evaluation code base. We encourage users to switch to the new codebase. The [data guide] (https://weatherbench2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-guide.html) is still up-to-date. ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨**

## Why WeatherBench?

WeatherBench 2 is a framework for evaluating and comparing data-driven and traditional numerical weather forecasting models. WeatherBench consists of:
- Publicly available, cloud-optimized ground truth and baseline datasets. For a complete list, see [this page](https://weatherbench2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-guide.html). 
- Open-source evaluation code. See this [quick-start](https://weatherbench2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/evaluation.html) to explore the basic functionality or the [API docs](https://weatherbench2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) for more detail. Since high-resolution forecast files can be large, the WeatherBench 2 code was written with scalability in mind. See the [command-line scripts](https://weatherbench2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html) based on [Xarray-Beam](https://xarray-beam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [this guide](https://weatherbench2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/beam-in-the-cloud.html) for running the scripts on GCP using [DataFlow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow).
- A [website](https://sites.research.google/weatherbench) displaying up-to-date scores of many of the state-of-the-art data-driven and physical approaches.
- A [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15560) describing the rationale behind the evaluation setup.

WeatherBench 2 has been built as an evolving tool for the entire community. For this reason, we welcome any feedback (ideally, submitted as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/google-research/weatherbench2/issues)) or contributions. If you would like you model to be part of WeatherBench, check out [this guide](https://weatherbench2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit.html).
